# RGCMP

Rock Glacier Common Midpoint Profile analysis repository contains the data and code used to calculate the radio wave speeds and generated the associated figures presented in Meng et al., 2022. 

Table of contents

cmpLS.m : MATLAB fuction to find the least squares fit for wave speed and travel time for a given CMP hyperbola. 

mix_rule.m : calculates the ice/rock ratio using a generalized dielectric mixing model, given constituent dielectric constants and the effective bulk dielectric constant measured in the field.
